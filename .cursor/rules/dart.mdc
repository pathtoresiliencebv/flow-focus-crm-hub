Project Rules for Cursor ‚Üî DART (MCP Integration)
1. Project Context

For this project we use the SmansCRM Space.
ID: ZINnNW33ybAz-SmansCRM
URL: SmansCRM Space

2. Task Management via MCP

All actions and updates must be synchronized with DART AI through MCP.

This means: whenever you create, update, or complete a task in Cursor, make sure it is immediately reflected in DART.

Cursor is the working environment, but DART is the source of truth for project tracking.

3. Workflow Rules (To Do ‚Üí Doing ‚Üí Done)

Always move tasks through the workflow stages:

To Do ‚Üí not started yet

Doing ‚Üí currently in progress

Done ‚Üí completed

Task descriptions must always be updated when moving between stages:

When moving a task from To Do ‚Üí Doing, update the description with what is being worked on and the initial implementation approach.

When moving a task from Doing ‚Üí Done, update the description with what has actually been completed, including notes about any technical or design decisions.

4. Task Structure

For large features or major changes (e.g., building an email system), create a main parent task (e.g., email-integration).

Break down the implementation into subtasks under that parent task (e.g., set up SMTP, create templates, integrate with user accounts).

Each subtask follows the same rules (To Do ‚Üí Doing ‚Üí Done, with updated descriptions).

5. Quality and Consistency

Descriptions must be clear, detailed, and written in English.

Every completed task should give enough context so that someone reviewing the board later understands what was built and why.

Never leave tasks in ‚ÄúDoing‚Äù without progress notes.

Always check that task titles are short and descriptive (e.g., Fix login bug instead of Bug).

üëâ This way, Cursor stays your coding/creation environment, while DART always has the up-to-date status and history of every task.
