# If you see build errors, make sure:
# 1. app/receipts/index.tsx does NOT import from 'expo-camera'
# 2. app/receipts/index.tsx does NOT import from 'expo-image-picker'  
# 3. app/receipts/index.tsx does NOT import from 'expo-file-system'
# 4. app/receipts/index.tsx ONLY imports from 'react'

# Correct version (web-safe):
# import React from 'react';
# export default function ReceiptsScreen() {
#   return <div>...</div>;
# }
